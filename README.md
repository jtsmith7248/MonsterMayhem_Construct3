This repo holds a two level platformer that shows off a game with over 100 events, 9 sheets to handle game layout and logic, in addition to the usage of various artwork from the public domain. 

Our Protagonist, Spritz, has to make it out of this dimension alive and intact! Help him get there by collecting coins, shooting enemies, avoiding lava, and grabbing crystals to heal him!
